# word2vec-nlp

Word2vec refers to the CBOW and skipgram unsupervised learning algorithms for generating word embeddings for use in natural language processing tasks and deep learning models.

This is a working implementation of skipgram with AdaGrad gradient descent in pure Python and numpy and ~100 lines of code. Not optimized for real world use but possibly a good learning tool.
